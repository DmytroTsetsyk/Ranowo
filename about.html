            Why did we build this?
        </h3>
        <span class="info-block-text">
            We built Ranowo because we that there was a need for us to have a safe space to donate to our community. We wanted to build something that was F.U.B.U (For US By Us). Our founder traveled for weeks around the U.S. to 5 major cities and volunteered at different non-profits in urban areas. She saw first-hand, how tangible donations to non-profits (art supplies, clothing, sanitary items, etc.) were making a difference in Black & Latinx communities. We also learned that if people are given the option, they would much rather donate an item than give money without context on how it would be spent. There’s so many great nonprofits doing amazing work in the Black &n Latinx communities. We should support them, period!

              Why is this important?
          </h3>
          <span class="info-block-text">
              Millennials are changing the landscape of giving to non-profits and their needs to be more tools in place that makes donating feel good and easy. Also, the data suggests that many Black and Latino donors have been left out of mainstream fundraising efforts. Giving via core fundraising channels—direct mail, email, etc.—falls well below the overall average. Black donors say they are asked to give less often and say they would give more if only they were asked. Furthermore, both communities (especially the Black community, almost 60% interviewed) feel that it is their responsibility to support non-profits that positively impact their unique community. In the age of gentrification, social injustice and political unrest it’s important that we build platforms and systems that help bring up the Black & Latinx communities, not tear down.
